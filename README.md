# CMOS Oscillator in 5G Communications

This project presents the design and simulation of a CMOS ring oscillator optimized for high-frequency, low-power 5G applications. The design was implemented using 45nm CMOS technology in Cadence Virtuoso.

## 📌 Features

- Ring oscillator with current starvation & negative skewing (ROCSN)
- SAPON technique to reduce leakage and static power
- Designed & simulated in Cadence Virtuoso
- Verified using DRC & LVS checks

## 📈 Results

| Design          | Frequency (GHz) | Power Consumption (µW) |
|-----------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| ROCSN           | 36.36           | 492.0                    |
| SAPON-Enhanced  | 28.44           | 277.7                    |
